Hello, World! I'm Tony Chan (a.k.a. tnychn).

I'm a Hongkonger, currently an undergrad BEng(CE) student at CUHK.

I'm also a software developer doing full stack web development (backend primarily),
occasionally some systems programming and mobile app development.

## Projects

Below are some of my open-source projects which I consider "completed".

- [tapgen](https://github.com/tnychn/tapgen)
– a command-line project generator written in Rust
- [opencc-extension](https://github.com/tnychn/opencc-extension)
– a browser extension to convert webpages between Chinese variants
- [media-controller-extension](https://github.com/tnychn/media-controller-extension)
– a Firefox extension that mimics Chrome's media control button

## Stack

The *GOSP* stack is my current favourite.

- **Backend:** Go/httpx + Postgres
- **Frontend:** TypeScript/Solid.js + Kobalte + Tailwind

I'm constantly exploring for more interesting frameworks to learn.

Elixir/Phoenix and Dart/Flutter are probably my next.

## Skills

- Python, Go, Rust
- JavaScript / TypeScript
- Node.js, React / React Native
- Git, Docker, SQL

## Tools

I mainly use my MacBook Pro 14" (2023) for development.

- **Keyboard:** Keychron K3 Pro
- **Mouse:** Keychron M3
- **Editor:** VSCode
- **Terminal:** Alacritty

and Raycast is my must-have productivity tool on MacOS.
